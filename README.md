**Credence** is a revolutionary decentralized marketplace for invoice financing that transforms traditional receivables into programmable financial assets on Solana. Built on the Finternet protocol, Credence bridges real-world trade with on-chain liquidity, enabling businesses to unlock immediate working capital while providing financiers with transparent, trustless investment opportunities backed by real-world receivables.

## 🎯 The Problem We Solve

### For Financiers
- **Limited Asset Classes**: Few transparent ways to access receivables as investments
- **Lack of Liquidity**: Trillions in trade receivables remain locked and unproductive
- **Centralized Systems**: Traditional financing lacks transparency and efficiency
