**Credence** is a decentralized invoice financing marketplace built on **Solana** and powered by the **Finternet protocol**, transforming real-world receivables into programmable financial assets and bridging trade finance with on-chain liquidity.


##  The Problem We Solve

Global trade finance is broken. Businesses wait 30‚Äì120 days to unlock cash tied up in receivables, while banks offer slow, opaque, and exclusionary financing. At the same time, trillions in invoices sit idle‚Äîilliquid, unproductive, and locked inside centralized systems‚Äîleaving financiers with limited, inefficient ways to deploy capital. What‚Äôs missing is an interoperable financial base layer that can turn receivables into programmable assets, deliver instant liquidity, and ensure transparency at scale. This is where **Solana‚Äôs high-performance rails** and the **Finternet protocol‚Äôs open architecture** come together to transform trade finance into a borderless, on-chain marketplace.

##  Our Solution

Credence introduces a **Solana-native model** for invoice financing that combines trustless infrastructure with real-world trade:

###  Core Features

#### 1. **Invoice Tokenization on Solana**
- **NFT Route**: Each invoice as a unique NFT with embedded metadata on Solana
- **Token-2022 Program**: Advanced fungible tokens with programmable transfer hooks and partial payments
- **Decentralized Storage**: Secure invoice data on Arweave/IPFS with Solana metadata
